Satish has worked on this issue. It appears that these changes are related to Redis cache usage. A retry loop has been implemented for retrieving Redis credentials during startup. Version GCP==4.29.0b2471 includes a fix for the issue, which ensures that if the vault cannot retrieve the credentials, it will ignore the error and proceed to the next steps.
