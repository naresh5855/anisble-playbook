After reviewing the situation, weâ€™ve determined that the increased interpreter time on RHEL 9 compared to RHEL 7 is likely due to OS-level changes. As this involves deeper OS-specific factors, we cannot investigate further at our end. It may require attention from system administrators or OS vendors.rsync -avz --exclude "gcp_amps" /gcp/prod1/apps/ your_ssh_user@hostB:/gcp/prod1/apps/
