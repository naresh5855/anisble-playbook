I've received confirmation from our architecture team (Dave) regarding the process to download and install NGINX Plus. While they work on spinning up a license server, we’ll temporarily download certificates and keys directly from the F5 portal. We’re facing a few challenges because our hosts don't have internet access, meaning we usually can't download from RPM or perform it via satellite server. However, the F5 repositories will maintain the NGINX Plus distributions, so we need to verify which specific packages must be downloaded from the F5 repositories. Additionally, I couldn’t locate the RHEL Linux distribution in the dropdown menu for download. Could you arrange a call to go over this? Let me know if you'd prefer me to submit a ticket through the F5 portal.
