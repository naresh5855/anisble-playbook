We tested the read and write throughput on the NAS mount, and it didnâ€™t take more than 30 to 60 seconds. To replicate the architecture, I created a simple Flask app, ran it with uWSGI, and hosted it on NGINX with similar configurations. The file seems to be uploading within approximately 29 seconds. Since production is currently running, we can't debug further. Tomorrow, during the platform release, I'll point the DNS and LBaaS to my simple Flask file upload service and conduct tests to identify the bottleneck.
