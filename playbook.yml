Based on the analysis below, the request is being passed to the sys workflows service. Approximately 100 queries are taking more than 60 seconds, causing the sys-wf NGINX to return with a response after the nginx_ui times out. Jaylen is working on replicating this issue in the sbx-beta environment. Once done, we will adjust the timeouts in nginx_ui and also check the send timeout from sys-wf NGINX, as it is able to make queries and receive responses, as observed in the sys-wf logs. This will help us determine if the issue still persists.
