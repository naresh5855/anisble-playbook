After reviewing the current situation, it seems that no similar issues have been reported following the cleanup of the database sessions. However, the presence of over 120 inactive sessions during this time raises some concerns. Despite the connection pool being set to 1048*, we're still experiencing delays, suggesting an underlying issue beyond just the session cleanup.

It's important to note that the database will continue to accept connections as long as the total number of active sessions does not exceed the maximum allowed connections in the pool, which is 1048. In this case, with 128 inactive sessions, these sessions are not actively using resources but still occupy slots in the connection pool. This leaves 920 available slots for new connections, meaning the database should continue to accept new connections until all 1048 slots are occupied, whether they are active or inactive
